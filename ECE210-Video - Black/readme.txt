What I learned from the project: <I learned a lot about team work and
									about planning a project among multiple people.
									I found the video Lab very very helpful. > 

Suggestions:   < Use a program/board that is compatible with the Mac-OSX.
				 Also make the labs a little more informative? I feel like i just applied what I 
				 already knew, I don't think I learned too much.>
